# Data-Engineering-SQL-Project
10Alytics Data Engineer Capstone Project Part one
In this project, the sample data related to COVID-19 cases as recorded from January 2019 to December 2020 was analyzed.
The data is provided as a CSV file, a database, and a table called covid_19_data was created to hold the data in a PostgreSQL server using Python. 
The data type of ObservationDate as type String was transformed to datatype DATE in the database and loaded to the PostgreSQL database using Python.
SQL queries to analyze and generate insight from the data was written in the Posgresql PG4 Admin. 
The insight generated includes 1. the total confirmed, death, and recovered cases. 2. the total confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases for the first quarter of each year of observation. 3. summary of all the records for each country. 4. the percentage increase in the number of death cases from 2019 to 2020. 5. information for the top 5 countries with the highest confirmed cases. 6. the total number of drop (decrease) or increase in the confirmed cases from month to month in the 2 years of observation.
The Python file, the SQL file for all the queries, and a folder containing the CSV file of each query can be found in the repository.
